# Mdm Development Tools

Awesome sauce for development environments. MDM Dev Tools is a WP Plugin that provides several key development tools, including:

- GIT webhook for collaborating on a project via GitHub, and pushing directly to staging
- Dev environment stats
- Cache Busting
- WP_DEBUG Log viewer
- Styleguides
- GIT event and issue tracking from within the WP Dashboard
- And more stuff...later...probably.
